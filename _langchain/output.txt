Copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate, also known as Blue Vitriol, comes in various forms, such as crystalline, powder, granular, and technical grades. It is primarily recommended for use in laboratories. 

The substance has potential health hazards, and one should avoid dust formation and use it away from incompatible products and excess heat. Copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate decomposes into sulfur oxides and copper oxides, which are harmful if exposed to high levels. The recommended exposure limit is a time-weighted average (TWA) of 1mg/m3. 

This chemical should be kept away from strong oxidizing agents due to its incompatible nature with such materials. Ensure proper ventilation and follow safety guidelines when handling this product.
