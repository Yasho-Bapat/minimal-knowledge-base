Here is some detailed information about Sulfuric Acid, based on the documents provided and sourced.

Sulfuric Acid is a highly corrosive liquid that can cause severe burns and eye damage. It is also a strong oxidant, meaning it can react with other substances to cause combustion. It is advised to avoid exposure to skin and eyes, and to seek immediate medical attention in case of such exposure. It is recommended to wear protective clothing and eye protection when handling Sulfuric Acid.

In the event of a fire, it is important to move the container away from the fire if it is safe to do so. Additionally, Sulfuric Acid can produce toxic gases when it decomposes, so it is important to wear respiratory protection when handling it. 

Though not mentioned in the provided documents, It's worth noting that sulfuric acid is also known to be a strong electrolyte, meaning it ionizes completely in water. This property is fundamental in its application in battery production, as well as its environmental implications following improper disposal. 

For any additional information or specific safety protocols regarding Sulfuric Acid, it is best to consult local safety experts or the material safety data sheet (SDS) for Sulfuric Acid, since specific details may vary by jurisdiction.
